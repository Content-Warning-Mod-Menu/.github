## Product Description

Content Warning is already a banger co-op fright ride: dive to the Old World, film weird monsters, survive, and cash in views. A solid mod menu layers a trainer-style overlay on top so you can toggle clutch powers mid-run‚Äîthink ESP to spot threats through walls, teleport for zero-downtime routes, invulnerability when the grabby boys get too friendly, and spawners for gear or props. It‚Äôs all about getting your squad back to the bell with the tape intact and your hearts still beating‚Ä¶ or at least beating again. The base loop is about filming monsters to go viral; the menu just hands you more control over how chaotic (or cinematic) each expedition gets.

## Features

**ESP & Radar**
See creatures, traps, loot, and teammates through walls with adjustable range and simple radar. Perfect for efficient routes and crisis awareness.

**Teleport & Custom Waypoints**
Drop a waypoint at the bell, labs, or your favorite loot hallway and zip back in a blink. Great for speed lines and last-second rescues.

**God Mode & Damage Tweaks**
Full safety, partial mitigation, or timed ‚Äúpanic button.‚Äù Keep the horror vibes without wiping the lobby every five minutes.

**Infinite Oxygen / Stamina Control**
Stretch those deep dives when the footage is spicy or your carrier tripped a mile from extraction. Some community mods even focus specifically on oxygen tuning and QoL toggles. 

**Item & Enemy Spawner**
Re-stock batteries, throw in props for filmmaking, or set up controlled encounters to farm high-view clips‚Äîwithout RNG.

**Host Tools**
Revive helpers, freeze mobs, clean griefers from the lobby, and force calm weather for visibility. Keep vibes tight, footage tighter.

**Hotkeys & Profiles**
Build presets: ‚ÄúLegit-ish,‚Äù ‚ÄúStreamer Safe,‚Äù ‚ÄúSpeedrun,‚Äù ‚ÄúCinematic.‚Äù Swap on the fly so your tape looks earned‚Äîbut your squad lives.

## Comparisons with Other Options

* **Vanilla + Workshop Tweaks:** Cosmetic or light QoL workshop items are clean and easy, but they won‚Äôt give you the full-fat menu powers like god mode or teleport. The game supports Steam Workshop, and the devs even ship an example plugin for creators‚Äîso simple add-ons are very accessible. 
* **Thunderstore Packs (BepInEx Ecosystem):** If you‚Äôre chasing deeper mechanical changes, Thunderstore builds with a mod manager are the go-to. You‚Äôll see staples like BepInExPack and dedicated mod managers to enable/disable sets per profile. This path is where trainer-like menus and bigger gameplay switches live. 
* **Bigger Lobbies Mods:** Fun idea, but community notes say server-side caps can hard-limit those larger rooms, so don‚Äôt bank your session on that. 
* **Client-Side vs. Everyone-Needs-It Mods:** Cosmetic or purely client-side tweaks typically mix with vanilla players; anything that changes core mechanics usually has to match across the lobby. That matters if only the host runs a menu‚Äîcheck tags and keep your group synced.

## System Requirements

No special hardware beyond the base game. If your rig runs Content Warning smoothly, a menu overlay or QoL mod stack won‚Äôt tip it over. For baseline specs and general performance expectations, always defer to the store page and your own in-game settings.

## Installation Instructions

**Heads-up first:** respect your squad. Use menus in private lobbies or with full consent. Modding can break compatibility across players; match your mod lists before queuing. Broadly:

### Path A ‚Äî Workshop-First (Simple Tweaks)

1. In the game‚Äôs Workshop section, subscribe to the items you want (cosmetics/QoL).
2. Launch the game; it auto-loads subscribed entries.
3. If something acts up, the developer FAQ shows how to clean out residual mod files and reset to a ‚Äúpure‚Äù install. Handy when troubleshooting. 

### Path B ‚Äî Thunderstore Build (Deeper Menus & Trainers)

1. Install a mod manager that supports per-profile toggles for the game.
2. Add **BepInExPack** for the game as the framework; run the game once to generate folders. 
3. Add your mod menu/trainer packages and supporting libraries within that profile.
4. Launch via the mod manager‚Äôs ‚Äúmodded‚Äù profile.
5. Sync the same set with your squad if the menu touches gameplay (revives, mob control, oxygen edits). 

**Fix-it notes:**

* After updates, some mods may target the wrong BepInEx version. If stuff feels cursed, check console logs and mod pages for version bumps. 
* If a menu silently fails, temporarily disable everything but the framework and the menu itself, then re-enable dependencies one by one.

## Safety, Fair Play & Account Risk

Content Warning‚Äôs devs actively support modding (Workshop/API examples, public notes), but heavy trainer powers in public lobbies can still ruin runs for others. Keep it consensual and private. Also, anti-cheat in online titles can be gnarly at a kernel level in other games; be mindful of drivers, overlays, and what‚Äôs running on your system, and always prioritize trust + transparency with your crew.

## Conclusion

If your goal is cinematic tapes and zero scuffed wipes, a Content Warning mod menu is basically a director‚Äôs toolkit: ESP to frame the action, teleport to save the take, item spawns for set-pieces, and safety nets so the bell ride home isn‚Äôt a coin flip. Lean lighter for ‚Äúearned‚Äù highlights, or go full sandbox and turn the Old World into your studio lot. Just keep your squad aligned on what‚Äôs toggled, and you‚Äôll turn every expedition into a binge-worthy reel. üé¨
